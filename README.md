# VR Iso Gaze Contours

## step 1 - get the dataset
Dataset either download 
https://gin.g-node.org/ioannis.agtzidis/360_em_dataset
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ot49ymfZh9UjXrA4vDW9HAq9x_YmL8kg/view?usp=sharing

## step 2 - Generate the model 
The model can be generated by using the file :
python_model/main_controller.py
which will allowyou to run trough the following steps:
1 - data --> angular velocities
2 - angular velocities --> distributions 
3 - distributions --> contours
4 - train encoder with contours  

## step3 - Import the model in unity 
The model for tensorflow light can be generated by using the file:
python_model/keras2tflite.py
the folder unity_project contains a ready to be tested project which use a previously generated model
